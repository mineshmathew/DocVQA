[{"context": "the shell coal summary gasification process (scgp) is a clean and efficient process for converting coal into synthesis gas. synthesis gas is a versatile mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be converted into many valuable products: electricity, synthetic natural gas, chemicals and liquid transportation fuels among them. scgp is competitive for all applications because of its simple operation, its dry feed system and its generation of superheated steam in the syngas cooler which give excellent thermal efficiency. november 1986 fourth advanced coal gasification

used formulation for kool. status : b&w has been studying the perception of menthol, cooling, and irritation in cigarettes. studies have focused on standardizing panel evaluating methods, separating spatial effects on perception and the interaction of menthol with tobacco impact and irritation. preliminary work also attempted to differentiate the contributions of l- and d- menthol with regard to various flavor and irritation effects. while these studies have recognized the complexity and importance of menthol in cigarettes, no systematic study has been done to characterize the flavor and irritant aspects of all menthol isomers, differences between synthetic and natural menthol sources and specific components (e. g. menthanone, menthyl acetate) of natural menthol in mediating flavor and irritation. we believe that a systematic characterization would assist in separating the trigeminal contributions from definitive flavor components. in conjunction with these psychophysical characterizations of menthol, we would also begin to study mixtures of menthols to characterize interactions between menthols and other non-menthol components (e.g. , nicotine). these studies would provide direction for product development and optimization by identifying specific characteristics/components. n. ayya/r. de wijk (5/11/93) p0a1979 . wp source:

not appear to be a factor which drives smokers to switch categories (intensity band, circumference, length) or give up taste. for those smokers who said the benefit was important it still is perhaps not powerful enough to support a freestanding brand but needs to be part of a familiar brand family. when cued to the fact that vsss were \"low smoke\" smokers said they could believe this claim. however, the fact that vsss were low smoke did not significantly, if at all, encourage trial of the cigarette. the uniqueness of the cigarette, the attractive packaging, and coupons were the primary reasons smokers tried the cigarette. the most frequently mentioned problems with vsss were intensity, thinness, and hard draw; in short, design differences from a consumer's own brand. smokers

(two hundred of each cigarette were used for the flare-up testing.) the low aluminum level and reduced silicon level for the low silicate model shown in table 1 are indicative of the removal of clay from the inks. talc (magnesium silicate) is the other source of silicon in the inks. kimberly-clark's flare index test has also shown lower flare potential for the low silicate inks than for the

from: j. reynolds subject: why all acids aren't the same in affecting taste (and possibly smell, irritation, etc.) the attached material describes recent work that shows how the anion of a salt (e.g. , the part that comes from an acid, such as acetate from acetic, acid or chloride from hydrochloric acid) can affect the taste of the salt. in this work it's sodium chloride, but it suggests that other effects could arise from the presence of anions in chemosensory systems. it suggests that there may be very good biochemical reasons that a particular acid may be, more effective than acids in general in affecting the responses of a chemosensory system. while not ruling out the general effect of acids, it further suggests that to ignore possible anion-specific effects is unwise. perhaps this work will suggest ways for us to test its potential relevance to systems that are of interest to us. . . john 50960 9524 source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/prv10037", "qas":

friends who were smoking (primarily at bars) the cigarette. the cigarette was a conversation piece because it was novel looking--thin and classy thus very feminine. the remaining smokers were introduced to vsss through magazine ads and store promotions. of the total forty two one-on-one interviews, about half initially purchased vsss and the remaining half bummed cigarettes from friends. the reasons that smokers initially were interested in trying vsss were because of coupons and promotionals, novelty, catchy packaging and friends offering to share vsss. none of these smokers said that they initially purchased vsss because they were seeking a product which offered low smoke. recall of advertising fifty percent were able to recall seeing advertising for vsss. however, of this fifty percent two thirds said the ads did not convey the message that vsss were \"low smoke.\" of those who had not been cued to the low smoke characteristics by advertising, half noticed during trial that vsss had less smoke coming from the lit end. continuing to smoke vsss only a couple of the respondents have made vsss their regular brand. the primary reasons cited for not continuing to smoke vsss were design differences from their own current brand (too strong or too weak, hard draw, and thinness). perceptions of weak taste were probably affected by the circumference of the product; prior to trial these smokers perceived that the cigarette would have a weak taste because it was thin. thinness was seen as a factor which contributed to drawing attention to smoking--not something these smokers want. the thin circumference was also viewed by the majority as too hard to get use to--uncomfortable in their hand and mouth, easily misplaced, and too fragile. 2022156003 source:

growth in our emerging and developing markets. the growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; . eurasia and africa was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as india and russia. the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; latin america was favorably impacted by pricing in a number of our key markets and the impact of still beverages

'i agree with you that fda should be extremely careful about entering into agreements by which the work product of such groups could automatically become the basis for a rule or other action by fda. our recent practice indicates that we will review such arrangements with caution. for example, we have discouraged usp's efforts to become our \"sole source\" supplier of patient package inserts for drugs, in part because their processes are not publicly accessible in the same way ours are. we have made it clear that while we would welcome their ideas, we would first seek public comment on any usp-generated draft on which we proposed to reply. we have also encouraged the cosmetic, toiletry, and fragrance association to ensure that the processes--including virtually all meetings--of the ingredient review program be open to public attendance and participation. these efforts have met with some success. we also have made it clear that fda will not automatically accept the judgments of the panel as the basis for regulatory action on specific ingredients. furthermore, our regulations governing participation of fda employees in outside standard-setting activities impose conditions designed to enhance public access to the workings of the groups on which we can be represented. see 21 cfr 10.95 (enclosed). : .. . ... source: https://www.industrydocuments.tesf.", "qas": [{"id": 856, "question": "What is the name of addressee in this letter?"}, {"id": 858, "question": "What is the name of the sender?"}, {"id": 6809, "question": "what is the designation of Mr. Robert B.Choate ?"}, {"id": 6810, "question": "What is the company name where Mr. Robert works?"}, {"id": 6811, "question": "What is the name of the Avenue ?"}]}, {"context": "page 6 - robert b. choate review. we are working toward a final position with every intention of responding as best as possible to consumer needs. regarding sugars, we now have underway a series of state-of-knowledge reviews on the role of specific individual sugars and sugar alcohols in human health and disease. these are being performed for us by the life sciences research office of the federation of american societies for experimental biology, and we anticipate receipt of all of their reports on the subject by mid-winter. these reports along with other scientific knowledge and experience, will form the basis for develop- ment of an agency position on labeling of carbohydrates, simple sugars and sugar alcohols. it is one of my particular interests to develop and publicize a compre- hensive nutrition policy and a similar policy for consumer research and action programs particularly relative to the food supply. we are working on achieving these goals which have my wholehearted support. in addition i invite you to contact dr. allan forbes of our bureau of foods for as detailed a review of our nutrition research programs as you may wish to have. thank you again for bringing these concerns to my attention. i hope this letter is fully responsive; if it isn't, let's talk. sincerely yours, donald kennedy commissioner of food and drugs womansource:https /www.indestrydocuments esfewdortmund", "qas": [{"id": 875, "question": "Who is the Commissioner of Food and Drugs?"}, {"id": 878, "question": "What is the page number indicated in this letter?"}, {"id": 880, "question": "Which person from Bureau of Foods is contacted for review of nutrition research programs?"}]}, {"context": "page 4 - memorandum of meeting that they are searching for a means to have uniform open date labeling--that open date labeling for non-perishable products is not needed--that a selective program is now being tried in portions of the industry. \"use date\" is the date being used and the date preferred. dr. kennedy stated that time is available to think about all of the possibilities.

in a \"weight of evidence\" narrative, there is no clear definition for what it means to conduct a \"weight-of-the-evidence\" evaluation. in addition, when discussing \"sufficient information,\" the guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment note that \"[glenerally, 'sufficient' support is a matter of scientific judgment in the context of the requirements of the decision maker or in the context of science policy guidance regarding a certain mode of action.\" neither of these definitions is of sufficient clarity to inform stakeholders as to the meaning of the terms that epa will be using to inform risk evaluation under lcsa. although epa suggests generally that these terms will evolve over time and continue to change, the agency points to no particular term and offers no explanation why it believes the meaning of a term will change. acc struggles to think how these definitions may change. while the data sets used to inform some definitions surely change with advances in high-throughput and high content methodologies, acc cannot identify instances where these definitions have changed. for example, in 1996, congress emphasized, and described, using the \"best available scientific evidence\" for risk information in amendments to the safe drinking water act (sdwa). we can think of no examples where this description has needed to be modified in the last 20 years, and the description appears to have created no problems for the agency. nevertheless, even if there were to be a need to change specific definitions if a term became a problem for the agency, there is nothing that stops epa from updating and modifying the definition in a future rulemaking. as requested by epa, below we suggest specific definitions or definitions which are alternatives to the language epa has provided. acc is not proposing to \"freeze\" the science, and indeed best available science depends on the converse. scientific advancements will be important to ensuring the effective and efficient implementation of the lcsa. each of the definitions below allows for scientific inputs and approaches to evolve and improve over time to inform chemical risk evaluations. i. best available science. acc suggests the following definition: best available science means information that has been evaluated based on its strengths, limitations and relevance and the agency is relying on the highest quality information. in evaluating scientific information, the agency will also consider the peer review of the science, whether the study was conducted in accordance with sound

substances control act (tsca) as amended by the frank r. lautenberg chemical safety for the 21\" century act (lcsa). risk evaluation is the very heart of lcsa. lcsa envisions a streamlined process whereby all chemicals in commerce are systematically prioritized for, and then subject to, risk evaluation. epa has described this process as a pipeline. two critical design elements of lcsa that facilitate movement through the pipeline are the statutorily mandated timelines for risk evaluations and science quality requirements. our comments explain why these two design elements of tsca - the need for timely, high quality risk evaluations - inform the application of a number of key provisions of the amended statute. in short, risk evaluations must be scoped, conducted, and completed in a way that meets statutory deadlines and quality requirements, and these imperatives must govern the way in which epa applies a number of statutory terms. congress intended to redesign how tsca risk evaluations work, as well as the pace of review. epa cannot interpret individual provisions and definitions under lcsa to undermine these core objectives. we offer overarching comments, followed by specific comments responding to epa's questions set out in the preamble, and conclude with additional specific recommendations on the conduct of risk evaluations. overarching comments i. epa should flexibly scope risk evaluations to include those conditions of use that allow timely completion of risk evaluations and meet section 26 scientific standards. section 6(b)(4)(g) establishes a maximum time period of three years to complete a risk evaluation (subject to a possible extension of six months), with the throughput criterion of having at least 20 risk evaluations on high-priority substances (plus up to 20 risk evaluations of manufacturer-requested chemical substances) underway by december 2019. congress designed a statute that makes it possible for epa to meet this throughput requirement by exercising flexibility in scoping risk evaluations, and by selecting the conditions of use targeted for review. acc represents the leading companies engaged in the business of

high priority substances efficiently and effectively. as noted above, differentiating and designating low-priority substances-chemicals with clearly low hazard and exposure potential-enables the agency to communicate to the public and the commercial sector those chemical substances for which potential risks are likely low or nonexistent. the scientific methods and procedures are available, or will soon be available in the case of 21st century tools, for epa to conduct risk based prioritization, and the agency should make use of these best available scientific tools for prioritization. recommendation: for all the reasons discussed above, epa should revise its proposed rule to make clear that the agency has broad and flexible authority to designate chemicals as low priorities for risk evaluations based on a, some or all conditions of use. v . scientific standards must be referenced in the prioritization process rule a. prioritization decisions must be based on section 26 standards for best available science, weight of the scientific evidence, and transparency pursuant to section 26 of the lcsa, epa must ensure that its high and low priority designations under section 6(b) are based on the best available science and the weight of the scientific evidence and that it make the basis of its decisions available to the public. because these are prioritization decisions, however, it is acc's expectation that epa's application of these standards would be \"fit for the purpose\" of prioritization as opposed to risk evaluation. for example, greater uncertainty and more conservatism in the \"best available science\" information that is used for prioritization purposes may be anticipated. prioritization decisions might be made on the basis of estimated information from an exposure model while a risk evaluation decision might require actual exposure information in some cases. acc urges epa to reference the section 26 science standards in the prioritization process rule in order to hold itself accountable to meet these standards within its section 6 decisions designating high and low priority substances for risk evaluations. the sections 26 (h), (i) and () provisions are legally mandated requirements of the lcsa and are equally applicable to the prioritization process and risk evaluation \"rule\" requirements. including references to these sections in the rule itself would aid understanding and application of these requirements by epa, the regulated community and stakeholders. this in turn would better ensure consistency in epa's prioritization decisions over time, and ultimately enhance the credibility of these decisions. importantly, because epa's low priority designations are subject to judicial review, clarity on the application of epa's science standards is necessary. if congress had intended the scientific standards of \"best available science\" or \"weight of the scientific evidence\" to be incorporated into guidance alone, it would have included them only in section 26(1) on \"policies, procedures and guidance.\" in addition to including these standards in the prioritization rule, epa can certainly also describe some of the details of its prioritization methodology and decision making process in later-developed guidance. inclusion in the rule of specific references to sections 26(h), (i) and (j) requirements about the scientific information, methods, models, characterization of uncertainty of information to prioritize, and use of weight of the scientific evidence to make decisions, puts the regulated community on notice about the quality of the information needed for epa to support sound prioritization decisions. if epa only includes references to these standards in guidance, it implies that epa could

\"sentinels of exposure\" or 'sentinel products\". the concept involves identification of a specific product (sentinel product) within a broad category (e.g. liquid laundry detergents within the broad category of household cleaning products) whose usage leads to the highest level of exposure relative to all other products within the category. therefore, establishing that exposure to the sentinel product is \"safe\" (lower than an appropriate reference, e.g. a dnel) allows to conclude that exposure derived from any other product within the category is also safe. this concept is proposed by the canadian health authorities in their 2005 document entitled: \"a proposed integrated framework for the health-related components of categorisation of the domestic substances list under cepa 1999\" (health canada, 2005). the same concept is also described and proposed by the us soap and detergent association (sda) as one useful approach for what they call \"screening-level assessments\" (sda, 2005). this concept can be also applied to specific types of activities within one single type of product to determine the one that is associated with the highest exposure (e.g. laundry pre-treatment of clothing could be the \"sentinel activity\" among the different potential activities associated with a laundry detergent, such as hand wash, fabric wear, and so on). a similar approach has also been described for cosmetic and personal-care products by the european cosmetic and toiletry association (colipa), in collaboration with us research institute for fragrance materials (rifm) and the brussels-based international fragrance association (ifra). in this case, the dermal route is identified as largely predominant and a small number of product types are shown to contribute disproportionately to the exposure. accounting for the exposure contributed by those key products is all that is really needed for a sound risk assessment. the definition above is consistent with the approach used by the european centre for ecotoxicology and toxicology of chemicals (ecetoc) in its targeted risk assessment user guide, which has been used extensively in reach and is accepted by echa, and is also consistent with the approach used by health canada. in the approach developed by health canada, a quantitative upper bound exposure estimate is used. however, in none of the descriptions provided, does the sentinel exposure equate with the \"maximal\" exposure to an individual or population. it is a term used to describe the type of product for which exposures will be highest compared to other products or exposures within the similar category. it does not imply that the maximal exposure (which could be the 99.99\" percentile or higher) is used for risk evaluation. thus, epa's definition is not consistent with the common use of \"sentinel exposure.\" epa should consult with its canadian and european chemical regulatory counterparts to improve the definition and approach epa is intending to use. see van engelen jg, heinemeyer g, rodriguez c. 2007. consumer exposure scenarios: development, challenges and possible solutions, j expo sci environ epidemiol.

conditions of use such as those described above as well as this blanket statement, which leaves open the possibility for additional exclusions: \"as epa gains experience in conducting risk evaluations, epa will likely also determine that other activities do not constitute conditions of use, based on the same types of analysis of congressional intent.\" in addition, one of the key criteria for prioritizing and evaluating risk of chemical substances as stated in the lautenberg chemical safety for the 2ist century act is \"...consideration of the hazard and exposure potential of

overall practice of risk assessment in the federal government, the office of management and budget (omb) released its proposed risk assessment bulletin on january 9, 2006, with a stated objective to \"enhance the technical quality and objectivity of risk assessments prepared by federal agencies.\" the bulletin presents specific standards for risk assessments disseminated by federal agencies. omb and the sponsoring agencies (environmental protection agency, u.s. department of agriculture, department of defense, department of energy, department of health and human services, department of labor, and national aeronautics and space administration) requested that the national research council (nrc) conduct a scientific review of the bulletin. in this report, the nrc's committee to review the omb risk assessment bulletin provides its assessment of the omb bulletin. the committee evaluates the standards presented in the bulletin, comments on the impact of the bulletin on the practice of risk assessment in the federal government, identifies critical elements missing from the bulletin, evaluates the consistency of the bulletin with previous reports of nrc and other organizations, and determines whether the draft bulletin has met omb's stated objective. this report has been reviewed in draft form by persons chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise in accordance with procedures approved by nrc's report review committee. the purpose of this independent review is to provide candid and critical comments that will assist the institution in making its published report as sound as possible and to ensure that the report meets institutional standards of objectivity, evidence, and responsiveness to the study charge. the review comments and draft manuscript

{"context": "the washington post wednesday, july 9, 1997 dancing around a dilemma global warming promises to become a large and gushing source of national hypocrisy by robert j. samuelson global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the next century, but -- regardless of whether it is or isn't -- we won't do much about it. we will (i am sure) argue ferociously over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. but the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed. little will be done. i wouldn't stake my life on that, but i don't see how it could turn out otherwise. democracies can't easily make present sacrifices to avoid future menacles. we require (it seems) a clear and present danger, if not a crisis, to stir us to action. this is why we won't soon mobilize against global warming. the politics simply won't compute. to do something effective would require a heavy energy tax or its equivalent. a good round figure for a tax is $100 per ton of carbon; this would raise gasoline prices an estimated 26 cents a gallon and electricity and natural-gas rates by almost 30 percent. the idea would be to dampen energy use and the emission of greenhouse gases (mostly carbon dioxide) from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas). to put it mildly, the odds of congress's passing such a tax are low. the problem with global warming is that we don't know yet whether it represents a genuine national threat and, if so, how large. congress might conceivably react to a legitimate threat, even if distant. but it won't impose pain on voters for no obvious gain to solve a hypothetical problem. and if the united states won't, neither will anyone else. we generate the most greenhouse gases, about 22 percent of the annual total. other countries won't squeeze themselves to preserve our lifestyles. i talked last week to global-warming believers and skeptics. despite policy differences, they tend to agree about the modest state of current knowledge. here's what we know. since the dawn of the industrial age (say 1800), the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen about 30 percent. in the past century, average surface temperatures have increased one degree fahrenheit (5 degree celsius). the widespread suspicion is that these trends are connected. industrial and transportation emissions increased carbon dioxide, trapping more heat in the atmosphere and raising temperatures. the rival theory is that the small temperature rise is a natural climatic variation. source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/jgg10228", "qas": [{"id": 5349, "question": "Which newspaper reading is given here?"}, {"id": 5351, "question": "What is

nationwide has become hundreds of thousands of acres a year. when it comes to restored wetlands the nation is veritably swamped. the study found that in 1995 the u.s. likely experienced an estimated net gain of 69,000 acres of wetlands. four federal programs restored 210,000 acres of wetlands in 1995, well in excess of the 141,000 acre estimated annual loss rate. three largely unheralded programs, the partners for wildlife program, the north american waterfowl management plan and the wetlands reserve program account for nearly 90 percent of the restoration. these three voluntary programs are both more popular and more effective at restoring and protecting wetlands that the army corps of engineers 404 program. in addition to being more effective, the study also showed that these three programs are also less expensive. the per-acre cost to the federal government for wetland protection under the 404 program is five times as expensive as protecting wetlands under the north american waterfowl management plan or the wetlands reserve program. \"compared with the voluntary programs, the corps of engineers' 404 program is a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" says tolman, \"not only is 404 a burden to landowners, but it is an extremely inefficient means of protecting wetlands.\" cei is a non-profit, non- achieving no net loss: probable scenario partisan public policy group

n.w., suite 800 on clinton administration assumptions washington, d.c. 20005 on economic impact of the kyoto protocol (202)628-3622 the clinton administration has publicly offered optimistic assumptions about what it will take to implement the kyoto protocol on global warming. in reality, the cost to american families could be ten times the estimates made by the administration because the administration has been excessively optimistic about the likelihood of an international trading system for trading greenhouse gas emissions credits. or. janet yellen, the chief white house economic advisor, has put the cost at between $14 and $23 a ton; economist w. david montgomery of charles river associates found the cost could be $170 a ton or more. under that forecast, the cost to the u.s. gross domestic product will be over $100 billion, about ten times the administrations forecast. to achieve the goals of the kyoto protocol, the administration has assumed that all coal-fired electric utilities in the united states could be converted to natural gas by the year 2010 when the treaty takes hold. dr. montgomery found this to be unrealistic and questions whether it will be economically feasible for utility owners to make that rapid a change. replacing coal-fired power plants with natural gas will be an enormously costly undertaking. there are many reasons - prices of trading credits abroad, lost jobs in the coal industry, limits on natural gas production. the administration appears to have gnored all these factors. to estimate the increased costs on american families of implementing the kyoto agreement, the administration measured only part of the costs that which comes directly from rising energy prices. dr. yellen's study left the enormous indirect costs to reverberate through the whole economy. according to dr. montgomery, costs to american families should be multiplied by two to four times when all factors are considered. these flaws in the administration's own analysis mean that instead of dramatically reducing its own emissions when the kyoto treaty takes effect, the united states will instead spend billions to purchase emissions credits - mutely in russia - to offset our own inability to meet the goals of the protocol. that kinstond if actually cutting back on our own greenhouse emissions,and doodle, we will be forced to make a massive transfer of wealth to other countries that are actually producing less greenhouse gases that they were in 1930. the alternative of trying to meet the ambitious schedule through reducing energy use within the united states is found under the administration's own assumptions to entail costs five times as large as the cost of buying permits overseas and ten things as much mande by dr.

it is a thin layer of food-grade aluminum foil between paper that encloses the heat source and tobacco, and which helps contain heat inside the tobacco while rod you're smoking the cigarette. 17) have you put strange chemicals or additives into this cigarette to get it to work the way it does? no. this cigarette contains a standard tobacco blend. a list of cigarette additives and ingredients is released annually to the public and to the dept. of health and human services. there is nothing in the smoke of this cigarette that isn't in the smoke of other cigarettes. also, eclipse smoke is mostly water and glycerin. 18) how much tar and nicotine does this cigarette have, and how does it compare to my cigarette? eclipse regular has 3 mg. tar and .2 mg. nicotine. eclipse milds has 2 mg. tar and . 1 mg. nicotine 19) how can i tell if my cigarette is lit? check the tip of your cigarette. it should be glowing red. if not, light it again, holding the flame to the tip for a few seconds, and taking an extra puff. 20) how long does this cigarette last? about as long as your usual brand, between six and seven minutes. some people get the impression that this cigarette doesn't last as long as their brand, probably because the cigarette doesn't burn down. if you feel that way, we suggest you time this cigarette and your usual brand, so you can compare it yourself. 21) how can i tell if my cigarette is done? after a while -- about 6-7 minutes -- you'll notice that you're getting less smoke and that the taste is weaker. these are signs that your cigarette is about done, and you would not want to relight it at that point. it simply takes some getting used to; but after a pack or two, you should feel pretty comfortable knowing when your cigarette is finished. 51444 9579

stands ready to work with the government to achieve the solution outlined above. assistance to farmers export potential for tobacco the company undertook a number of developmental activities in different tobacco areas to help uplift the farming community by transferring latest farm technology to achieve higher yield per hectare and better produce, enabling them to realise better prices and earnings per hectare. we also helped them introduce an integrated pest management system and supply of pheromone traps, nuclear polyhydro virus solution and neem products to reduce the pesticide residue in tobacco production. we also did trials on production of source: the tobacco institute of india flavourful tobacco to help farmers produce more exportable tobaccos and realise better profits, with very promising results. these efforts have been duly recognised by government scientists and tobacco board officials. progress in 2002/03 not unaccustomed to working in difficult environments, your company has managed to launch three new brands and grow our market share of the domestic cigarette industry to over 11%. this is a 104% increase on 2001-02 and was undertaken at a time when the industry had only marginal growth. this year saw the most significant investment in new and existing brands, including the launch of piper, tipper and prince. both piper and tipper involved new innovations in the indian market, with tipper's technology being copied by competitors. prince was launched in a totally revamped version with improved smoke as well as packaging. new campaigns were undertaken for four square and cavanders brands. the company also launched three cigar brands, phillies, hav-a-tampa and don. diego in the domestic market in 2002. these cigars are imported by the company under an arrangement with altadis of usa, one of the world's leading cigar manufacturers. to ensure that these new brands and your company's existing brands are well presented and accessible to customers, investments have been made in the sales and distribution system resulting in significant increase in retail servicing and brand presence. at the same time, we are investing in building stronger relationships with our trade partners. a major investment was made in r & d facilities at the mumbai factory to establish a state-of-the-art facility. further investments were made in upgrading both the manufacturing facilities. continued training and the application of the \"kaizen teian\" scheme have again resulted in improvement in overall operating efficiencies and reduction in manufacturing costs. in recognition of these efforts, the company won the highest award from insaan for the sixth successive year. tea the global over supply of tea led to bearish trends in commodity prices for the fourth successive year. these depressed market conditions led to a 9% decline in the domestic packet tea market resulting in its further fragmentation. to meet these challenges, the tea business was restructured and overheads reduced. the company focused on markets which satisfied contribution and profitability objectives, while exiting unviable territories. as a result of this the business achieved positive cash flows by the second half of the financial year. total segment revenues were rs. 31 crore for the year. good progress was made with opportunities identified in the high value, growth segment of out-of-home beverages. test marketing of innovative ways of addressing this market are planned during the current financial year. during the first quarter of the current year your company has achieved sales of rs.6.3 crore against rs. 7.2 crore in the corresponding period last year. the sales decline is mainly due to exiting low profitability areas in the domestic market and lower exports. domestic marginal contribution has been increased by around 2% over the corresponding period. source:

contracts in march 2000 with some manufacturing units in assam for purchase of certain quantities of cigarettes at economical prices, on account of these units enjoying exemption from payment of excise duty in pursuance of an exemption notification issued by the central government earlier. the government withdrew the exemption in january 2001 and, thereafter, these units closed down operations. however, there was a net outstanding amount of rs. 22.70 crore recoverable as on 31 march, 2003 from these units against the amount of advances given to them by the company from time to time for making deposits with excise authorities, which under the said arrangements, they were to return to the company on receipt of the refund of such deposits from the excise department. the government has, however, withheld some of the refunds of excise duty due to such units pursuant to the said exemption notification. the said manufacturing units had moved the guwahati high court against the unfair and illegal action on the part of the excise department. the court passed an order on 17 may, 2002 directing the excise department to grant refunds to these units. the excise department had then moved the appellate bench of the high court by way of an appeal. the division bench of guwahati high court dismissed the appeal of the central excise department on 4 april, 2003 and directed the department to refund the amounts within 30 days of the judgement. however, the finance bill, 2008 proposed a retrospective amendment to the notification, which sought to provide for the denial of refunds in terms of the notification from the date of its issue, i.e. 8 july, 1999. consequently, the refunds earlier granted to the assam units were also to be refunded back to the government within 30 days of the passing of the finance bill, which became an act after passage by the parliament and assent by the president on 14 may, 2003. notwithstanding the directions of the division bench of the guwahati high court, armed with the provisions contained in the finance act 2003, the department initiated action by issue of orders for recovery of the past refunds from the assam units and rejected all the pending claims. the assam units, therefore, sought the protection of the guwahati high court by moving a writ petition challenging the provisions of the finance act as being bad in law. source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/znbx0223", "qas": [{"id": 57739, "question": "What is the Gross Profit for the year ending 2003 (Rs.lac)?"}, {"id": 57740,

coordination with the global medical communications group within women's health care marketing, currently assists in managing the publications and presentations of the studies sponsored through women's health care, as well as managing and developing strategic publications. the overall goal of the publication management plan is to ensure that wyeth gains global exposure from each of the studies it supports, through publications in key medical journals and presentations at prominent scientific meetings. it also serves as a mechanism where everyone realizes the potential to contribute to and to utilize the publications team. the specific objective of the strategic publication program is to provide gap analysis of the current science and develop publications to meet the needs of physicians and their patients. we propose to continue this publication plan for 2004 with the development of additional scientific communications materials that support the current strategies of the women's health care team. specifically, we will continue to provide support for low-dose prempro and assist in issues management. we will also develop publications to prepare the marketplace for potential new non-hormonal products for vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis. publication management to accomplish the main goal of the publications management plan, we will: . gather publication and presentation information from global medical affairs, marketing, continuing medical education, and public affairs track the progress of phase iv clinical trials for the premarin family and the ongoing clinical trials with tmg and bza . recommend action steps for presentations and publications facilitate the dissemination of the study data to appropriate audiences in the global marketplace integrate all women's health publication plans into a master program design write will continue to contact investigators on a regular basis to determine the status of a given study and any manuscript or abstract submissions that are relevant to that study. through global medical affairs and monthly publications meetings, design write will help recommend appropriate audiences for data dissemination

targeting each audience is described below. specialists women's health care specialists involved in women's health care continue to be and will likely remain as those most actively involved in the counsel of ert/hrt in postmenopausal women. thus, this audience is a crucial target for relevant data pertaining to premarin data and ert/hrt counseling. in addition, it is imperative that information on the uniqueness of premarin and it advantages over emerging ert/hrt products be conveyed to those most active in ert/hrt counsel. furthermore, with the possible approval of a low-dose product, a number of new-start ert/hrt patients may result since patients may feel safer with a lower-dose estrogen. the women's health care physician will also play a key role in interpreting data regarding the use of serms in postmenopausal health, and subsequently educating their patients on these issues. bone and dental since the premarin\" family of products has been approved for the prevention and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, physicians managing patients osteoporosis can be targeted at bone-related meetings. although estrogen remains the first line of defense in osteoporosis prevention, newer products such as raloxifene and alendronate are now available for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. thus, it is imperative to bring to the forefront information demonstrating the advantages of estrogen over these new products. it is also crucial to present data pertaining to the combination of estrogen and parathyroid hormone, which has recently been shown as a possible \"cure\" for osteoporosis osteoporosis is correlated with maxillary bone loss and tooth loss. there i evidence that reatment of osteoporosis with ert/hrt can result in a lower risk of tooth loss. thus, players in the dental health care field could act as an additional source of counsel and recommendation of ert/hrt to their postmenopausal patients suffering from tooth loss. cardiovascular there is a growing body of evidence pointing to the potential benefits of conjugated estrogens on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. thus, it is appropriate to convey to cardiologists the beneficial effects of ert/hrt on cardiovascular parameters and the mechanisms by which ert/hrt can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. relaying 6 source:

impact of the program as well as future cme needs for health care professionals. in addition, the evaluation requirement serves as a market research cool with which to determine the incorporation of information about the premarin family of products and how attendees plan to change their practices. thirty-two states require ama physician's recognition award category 1 cme credits to renew state

interest in the topics covered and the excellent speakers we will recruit for the program. also, the requirement for 150 credit hours in a 3-year period should serve to maximize attendance at these meetings and the readership of the materials. objectives the main objectives of the proposed symposia are to: > educate health care professionals on the effectiveness of premarin in relieving

been primarily directed to the genetic characterization of tobacco mosaic virus and to the role of its nucleic acid in disease. he is recognized world wide as the leading authority on the in vivo functioning of the nucleic acid of tobacco mosaic virus, which is the most studied plant virus. in early work with s. g. wildman, siegel used ultraviolet radiation inactivation of virus in vivo to show that liberation of nucleic acid from the virion was an early step in infection, and to determine the time needed for this reaction and for nucleic acid replication. he established and maintained isolates of the virus as genetically characterized strains for research, and later showed that many strains of this virus have little nucleic acid base sequence homology detectable by nucleic acid hybridization. siegel early produced mutants of tobacco mosaic virus by chemical modification of the nucleic acid. his studies of diseases caused by mutants with defective virion coat proteins provided basic information on the in vivo role of nucleic acid, coat proteins, and virions. siegel's recent research has been on the replication and translation of tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acids and has shown that not the genomic rna in the tobacco mosaic virus particle, but a nonencapsidated low molecular weight viral rna serves as messenger for coat protein synthesis. these results have provided new insight on the replication strategy of single component plant viruses, on their relation to the multicomponent plant viruses with their divided genomes, and suggest a reason for the occurrence of the latter. source: https:/", "qas": [{"id": 59446, "question": "What is the professional title of Dr.Albert Siegel ?"}, {"id": 59450, "question": "From which university Dr.Albert Siegel

scheduling your course would be in the monday, wednesday, friday sequence from 1:00 to 4:30 p.m. with approximately one half hour for a coffee break somewhere in the middle of the afternoon. such a schedule would provide the least conflict of interest among the students in combining this with other courses in our contemplated curriculum. however, if such a time is not suitable for you and any plans which you may be making in terms of commutation and the like, then an alternate though less preferable time, would be from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon on tuesday, thursday and saturday in each of the three weeks. the minimum salary for your contribution to our program would be $1, 000 for the three-week period although we are currently in the process of increasing this significantly for the instructors. in any event your travel to and from minneapolis and a per diem adequate for your room and board would also be provided. our facilities are new and excellent as other faculty in the summer program can attest and we would obviously furnish all of the classroom materials which would be indicated for the successful conduct of the course. this could very well include reprints health

and evaluation of training program a. summer training program for medical students although only one period of summer training in epidemiology has been completed during the period of this report, it is desirable to describe briefly the experience in 1959 for purposes of comparison with future progress reports. early in 1959 an announcement of the program was sent to the deans and professors of preventive medicine in all of the medical schools in the continental united states. this announcement contained brief information concerning the program, a list of possible projects and activities to which students might be assigned, and application forms for students. the department received a total of 614 applications or inquiries concerning the program from students in 65 of the 78 four-year medical schools in the united states. after the elimination of non-citizens, applicants who did not hold college degrees, incomplete applications, and others who were not eligible, there were 480 applications from which to select the trainees. of the total group, 83 per cent were in their fresh- man or sophomore year; ages ranged from 20 to 37 years. there were 20 or more applicants from each of seven medical schools, and 23 schools each provided ten or more applicants. the subjects most frequently chosen for study by the applicants, in order of popularity, were: a study of the epidemiology of heart disease; study of reproductive loss; epidemiology of chronic alcoholism; and the evaluation of child health supervision. other areas of substan- tial interest included: social factors in health, air pollution, cancer epidemiology, and the epidemiology of occupational diseases. the reasons most commonly given by the students for desiring to participate in the program, in order of frequency, were: to see and learn more about public health; to supplement medical education; to see california; to participate in non-laboratory research; and to broaden their medical point of view. more than 80 students expressed interest in exploring a possible career in public health, interest in some particular community health problem or in some social factor in disease. from this group we selected a total of 36 students from 22 medical schools. six of these had participated in a similar program of this department during the summer of 1958. selection was made on the basis of scholarship, reasons for interest in the program, and on recommendation of some member of the medical school faculty. in every instance the candidates from a particular school and our choice of students from among the group were checked with some member of the faculty. two of the participants were women; two were premedical students who had been accepted for admission to medical school,

\"piggyback vs. multipurpose\" discussion continued regarding the use of generalist physicians in clinics. the \"piggyback\" approach described in last week's notes was reviewed. in the \"piggyback\" system, multiple services would be provided in a specialized clinic. an example being prenatal patients also receiving mandoux tests, thus relieving the patient from having to attend mmero numerous clinics. it was indicated that the \"piggyback\" approach would be a simple concept and would offer a feature of economy. this concept would not interrupt the present system of specialized clinics, only modify it. the multipurpose approach to clinic activities was also discussed. this concept implies use of the generalist physician to cover, in effect, one generalized clinic function, with referral to specialized climes when necessary . the administrative headquarters specialists (program directors) would be consultants ~. similar to specialists in private practice .... and would operate or assist in operating clinics in emergency situations or under special circumstances. task force members observed that with this concept, the physician would be patient oriented -. similar to private practice ... rather than program oriented. effects of comprehensive health planning on clinic activities a dxo indicated some concern regarding the effects of comprehensive health planning on district activities. because of comprehensive health planning, some members felt that the department of hospitals, for example, may supplement the health department in many medical services. it is difficult to tell where we are going when the department has not defined our role in compre. hensive health planning. in order for the department to be fully prepared for policy. the impact of

concept to get the \"nitty gritty\" out of the way. he stated that in the end we might compromise with a balance of specialists and generalists. the task force was then reminded of the upcoming apha study. the health officer stated the recommendations of the task force must be flexible and realistic rather than idealistic. he stated that we are headed in the direction of greater decentralization into the districts. this decentralization cannot be complete atonomy. health department physicians vs. other county department physicians the health officer made reference to page 2 of the october 15 notes: \"one reason for the difficulty we experience in hiring full-time physicians is the fact that we now compete with other county departments for full- time physicians. the reason for this competition is that the salaries for physicians in other depart. ments are higher -- an example being the department of hospitals. this is justified by the \"round the clock\" need for physicians in other departments. this factor is a definite disadvantage to this department. \" he mentioned that the salary difference stated above is not strictly comparable. health department physicians for the most part act as clinicians. he felt that the department of hospitals is in a better position for recruiting physicians for several reasons: 1. they recruit physicians for a technical specialty in many instances. 2. the department of hospitals is affiliated with u.s.c., thus offering on-going educational benefits to the physicians. 3. the department of hospitals physicians do not work strictly in a clinical capacity. when asked if the health department could not do something to develop prestige and improve its posture with the medical world, the health officer stated that this is not entirely impossible, but rather unlikely because to his knowledge, very few health departments in the state or nation have been successful in this attempt.", "qas": [{"id": 59695, "question": "What is

\"administrative responsibility\" were unclear to some. some could not see the difference between the two terms. it was explained that a supervisor gives guidance and direction to personnel and an \"administrator\" is one level removed. in terms of district activities, bureaus should not have direct administrative responsibility. it was concluded that this was redundent of the recommendations of last year and members were instructed to refer to the first set of task force recommendations for further information. it was further indicated that the health officer, on january 30, 1957, issued a directive which stated the relationship of \"district\" a \"project\" staff. this directive could also apply to \"bureau\" staff. a copy of the directive is attached. bureau relationship to

requested district involvement? the correct procedure would be for one bureau to contact the bureaus involved and request the bureaus to contact the various districts to get the dhos view of the person being requested for the bureau assignment or to ask the dno to make a suggestion. if the dhos contacted all feel the person in thier district would be the best for the assignment, the bureau should make the final decision because the bureau is able to judge the entire staff in the particular discipline, whereas the dho is able to judge merely the staff of his own district. at the same time, the dho must have the authority to say, \"no, i cannot spare this particular person at this time. you will have to get someone else.\" this is a dho decision because the dho is aware of the

and (2) full-time physicians are simply not interested. one reason for this difficulty is the fact that we now compete with other county departments for full-time physicians. the reason for this competition is that the salaries for physicians in other depart- ments are higher -- an example being the department of hospitals. this is justified by the \"round the clock\" need for physicians in other departments. this factor is a definite disadvantage to this department. the main concern at this time should be with the health officer's response to the generalist physician concept. it was decided not to further discuss the generalist concept until word from the health officer at next week's meeting. relationship of bureau personnel to program personnel one member brought up his concern over the responsibility and authority of the bureaus over personnel assigned to other divisions and projects. it was felt that a position funded in one bureau and organizational placed in a division of another bureau should have some relationship to both bureaus. the first responsibility was felt to be with the", "qas": [{"id": 60728, "question": "What is the page number?"}, {"id": 60730, "question": "What is the underlined word in the last line?"}]}, {"context": "c item 8(b). - page 3 (dept. of hospitals services provided by the health department and curative and rehabilitative services provided by the hospitals is closed.

builds through adapting this range of content to specific audience desires, needs and situations, a valuable by-product can be foreseen: development of corre- spondingly tailored materials. a 1979 analysis by dr. milgram reveals alcohol there is not an abundance of college-oriented materials. entitled education a descriptive analysis of alcohol education materials, 1973-1979 (journal of studies on alcohol, center of alcohol studies, rutgers materials university, in press), her study covers 854 titles published as books, pamphlets and leaflets by audience and quality, main concepts, and percentage distribution of main concepts according to audience. the analysis shows that although the quantity of published materials has increased in recent years and the audiences for whom they are directed have expanded, there is a disproportionately small number for college students. in fact, compared with seven other audience groupings, colleges were found to be next to the last in this regard. coupled with this, a conclusion can be drawn from the study that there is considerable need for refocusing of emphasis. dr. milgram makes this observation: a matter of \"it is of interest that the topic of intoxication has greater stress emphasis for all populations, including students, than responsible drinking. though the philosophy which stresses negative aspects of alcohol in the educational process is no longer generally espoused, some remnants of this still maintain a diminished strength in alcohol- education materials. \"the minor strength of responsible drinking for all populations (in the materials) also supports the lack of positive stress. since approximately 70 percent of the adult population and about the same percentage of adolescents in the united states

of medicine in the south as the southern medical association celebrated its golden anniversary it became clear to all that the record of these fifty years should be set down, to be read by those who would read among the members and friends of this organi- zation which has played such a large part in the advance- ment of medicine in the south. only one person could do this, and it is with great good fortune that mr. c. p. loranz, who helped build and directed this association from its early days to its maturity at fifty years, has undertaken this labor. the history of the southern medical association is the history of the men who built and strengthened the asso- ciation, who practiced medicine in the south and who con- tributed to the advancement of medical science. the growth of the association should be assessed in the historical setting of the half-century in which it reached its present stature. it has been a remarkable half-century in terms of advances in medical science and medical practice. a fifty years unequaled in which, one may say without ex- aggeration, the advances have been greater than in all pre- vious medical history. but even as one marvels at such amazing progress, one must recognize that it could not spring from sterile beginnings. over and over in the history of the human race one is struck by the periodicity with which new concepts and thinking have sprung up simultane- ously, often in diverse areas and even on different conti- nents, to fertilize the course of human events in some era of the world's history. thus the world witnessed the period of the concept of the freedom of man and its corollary, democ- racy, which caught man's imagination and spread like a prairie fire. source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsi.edu/docs/xnic0228",

(28), who reported a fat-calorie ratio of 35.2 percent in the diet of inland eskimos living at anaktuvuk pass in alaska. this finding is contrary to the popular belief that eskimos consume a high fat diet, since they have large quantities of seal oil, oogruk oil and blubber available. it is probably explained in part by the distribution of fat in the marine animals these people eat. the fat of a seal and many other arctic animals is predominantly in the sub- cutaneous layer of blubber. the muscles contain little of the marbling characteristic of domestic fattened animals. this fact is emphasized in comparison of fat content of various meats shown in table 32. the average ascorbic acid intake of 36 mg per day was low but only when compared to the nrc recommended allowances of 75 mg per day (27); however, this average intake was in the \"acceptable\" range according to the icnnd guide for interpretation of nutrient intake (table 33). of the 97 diets studied 53 individuals consumed less than 30 mg per day (\"low\" intake 10 to 29 mg). only two or three cases of known scurvy among alaskan eskimos have ever been reported by examining physicians and these", "qas": [{"id": 64733, "question": "What is the table number?"}, {"id": 64734, "question": "What is the protein content in seal(g/100g)?"}, {"id": 64735, "question": "What is the fat content in seal(g/100g)?"}, {"id": 64736, "question": "Which item has the highest fat content in the Alaskan Eskimo Diet?"}, {"id": 64737, "question": "What is the protein content in chicken(g/100g)?"}, {"id": 64738, "question": "Which item has highest fat content in US diet?"}]}, {"context": "western training laboratory in human relations 0707 partmen mar 1 8 1961 june 18-30, 1961 application form tahoe alumni center for 1961 western training laboratory june 18-30, 1961 helen walsh berkeley calif lake tahoe, california in human relations tahoe alumni center, lake tahoe, california. nutrition serv-sdph 2151 berkeley calif 1. name..... 2. address.... . city. business or 3. position....... professional affiliation...... please include with your application: (1) letters of reference from three persons in a position to judge your capacity to profit from participation in the laboratory.

canadian population pattern closely until about 6 years of age, then compared to canadian population dropped below it for the rest of the growth. weight growth in the 200 southern eskimos was faster than the canadian pattern until 8 to 10 years of age, then lagged below it. adult height of the southern 175. eskimos is about 3 inches shorter than that of the canadian population in both men and women. the adult weight of southern eskimo women is weight in pounds 150 females about 10 pounds below that of the canadian population. growth in both height and weight among the northern eskimos closely 125 followed that of the canadian population throughout the growth period. adult height is about one inch shorter than that of the canadian popula- 100. tion, for both men and women. adult northern eskimo women weigh about 10 pounds more than the canadian population; adult northern eskimo men weigh about 5 pounds less than the canadian population. 75. 50 x- -- - ---x southern eskimos the height curve for the athabascan indians falls close to that ............... northern eskimos for the canadian population. the weight curve for these people is close canadian population to that of the canadian population until age 10, when it lags. adult 25 height of athabascan indians is similar to that of the northern eskimos. adult weight is least in young adults, rising strongly in older groups. however, with such small groups as these there is a possible differential o age bias in the sampling. o 10 20 30 200 40 50 60 gross overweight was most prevalent in the northern eskimo villages (table 19b), especially in the women, and also in the women of the athabascan indian villages, and in young southern eskimo women. 175. the numbers of males and females in successive age groups are too weight in pounds 150 . moles small in the various ethnographic groups for conclusive statements to be made, and considerable obesity in these small groups, especially in 125. the older ages, produces indefinite averages. it is also possible that there is some degree of differential bias in sampling according to both age and sex, for example, there may have been sick people who did not 100 attend the examinations in the villages, and some of the adult males not in the national guard may have been away from the villages during the 75 time of the interviews. in general, it appears safe to conclude that the middle-aged adults tend to be slightly shorter than the younger 50 adults, and those over 65 are still shorter, with these differences being of small magnitude, similar in their appearance to the canadian population. beyond some rise in weight in the twenties, there appears 25 to be little weight change with age in the southern eskimo, and probably also in all the male groups examined, with probable rising patterns in women in the northern groups. o. c 10 20 30 40 50 60 the pulse data were of no interest except that they showed a age in years systematically higher rate by age for the northern than for the southern villages (table 21, figure x). the physician in the south was a woman. table 22 shows the examiner differences for pulse and blood pressure bom measurements of men in the two battalions of national guardsmen taken by a female (examiner a) and male (examiner b) clinician, respectively. the blood pressure readings made by examiner a are in all

of the army has been a most dif- 2 keelung ficult problem, and nutritional disease has taken a very heavy toll among the soldiers. in 1934, when the first survey of military nutrition was done, some taipei .25 1, 300 soldiers died of beriberi in one province alone (1). ten years later beri- taipei beri was found in 4.3 percent of a group of 3,428 soldiers examined by wan, chen, hsinchu taoyuan chen and chang (2). the prevalences of other nutritional disorders were: cheilosis, 31.0 percent; xerophthalmia, 12.9 percent; keratitis, 14.7 percent. the reduction hsinchi in the prevalence of beriberi during the period of world war ii was thought to be due to the use of less highly polished rice. the following year a clinical survey miaoli ilan revealed that only 40 percent of some 1, 200 soldiers examined were free from signs of malnutrition (3). the prevalences of stigmata of specific nutrient deficiencies were: calories, 14 percent under 85 percent of \"standard weight;\" protein, 3 per- ichung cent; vitamin a, 36 percent; riboflavin, 14 percent; vitamin c, 15 percent. there taichung were very few signs of thiamine or niacin deficiency. the transfer of the government and the armed forces to taiwan in 1949 did not chan - 24 improve the situation, for this movement added some 20 percent to the population hung nantou of that island which had not yet recovered from the effects of world war ii. soon hualien afterward the army medical service reported outbreaks of beriberi and of visual yunlin disturbances in the penghu (pescadores islands) and of night blindness generally. a clinical survey in a field army revealed a prevalence of visual impair- chiay ment of 24 percent and of angular stomatitis of 56 percent. at this time detailed enghu studies were undertaken at the national defense medical center in taipei of the nutritional value of soybeans, which led eventually to the general inclusion of this food in the army ration. tainan in may 1954, a brief survey was conducted (4) in which the prevalences of -23 tainan. ohsiung 23 - certain lesions were as follows: nasolabial seborrheicent; angular sto- matitis (2 +), 41 percent; magenta tongue, 51 percent; papillary changes of the kao tongue, 49 percent; follicular hyperkeratosis, 38 percent. the findings indicated taitung deficiencies of riboflavin, niacin and vitamin a. low intakes of vitamin c were also thought to exist. from october 1954 to february 1955 an elaborate test was kaohsiung made of a proposed new ration which included enrichment of rice with thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and iron, plus the addition of the sweet potato as a source of vitamin a activity and of vitamin c. this ration was highly effective in the pingtung improvement of nutritional status, both clinically and biochemically. this study, together with an investigation of methods and costs by the interdepartmental com- mittee on nutrition for national defense (5), led to the institution of rice enrichment for the chinese armed forces in april 1958, although a limited program -22' - 220 of diet enrichment by the use of vitamin-containing wafers during cooking had been started a year earlier. the program was supported by the mutual assistance pro- taiwan gram with the assistance of the u.s. military assistance advisory group, taiwan. 20 40 60 80 kilometers 100 several nutrition surveys have been carried out since 1955 by the chinese army medical service (6, 7). by 1957 the prevalences of lesions of vitamin a 120' 121 122\" deficiency had decreased considerably, as had some of the tongue changes thought to be due to niacin deficiency. the findings related to riboflavin deficiency did not improve until after the institution of rice enrichment.", "qas": [{"id": 37286, "question":

disease such as diabetes. three microvel prostheses (figure 6.06) implanted by the same surgeon and collected after two months, showed radically different healing characteristics; the first, b16, was the best in spite of the fact that it originated from a high risk patient (75 years-old, emergency surgery for a ruptured aneurism, post- operative kidney failure). all traces of healing were absent from a second prosthesis, b25, which originated from an elective patient (71 years old, diabetic). this same patient had an uneventfull post-operative recovery. the third device, b58, was also from an elective patient (59 years old, aneurism of the aorta). this device exhibited only a thin coat of fibrin with a smooth surface but without densification or organ- 65 cities.demo 03919-00079 source:

research examining the degree that replacement estrogen improves menopause-associated sexual changes has generated conflicting results (redmond, 1999). dyspareunia due to vaginal dryness appears to be most responsive to estrogen replacement therapy via restoration of vaginal cells, ph, and blood flow. ert has been reported to enhance sexual desire in a significant number of women, although some women's sexual difficulties remain unresponsive to ert. there also appears to be a subgroup who responds to ert initially, but who subsequently revert to their initial problems, especially when the initial problem is loss of libido. research supports the utility of adding androgen in this situation (sarrel, 2000). a major barrier to research on estrogen, menopause, and sexual dysfunction is that the female sexual response is difficult to quantify objectively. the changes that occur with female sexual arousal are difficult to measure, and not always recognized by the patient. comprehensive methods to measure female sexual function are currently under investigation (berman et al, 1999) and the testing and validation of these methods will help address many of the complex questions that remain about this very important aspect of women's lives. designwrite . 189 wall street, princeton, new jersey 08540 . 609/924-1116 . fax: 609/924-6648 confidential pursuant to confidentiality order
